#  Imagine you're working with Sprint, one of the biggest telecom companies in the USA. They're really keen on figuring out how many customers might decide to leave them in the coming months. Luckily, they've got a bunch of past data about when customers have left before, as well as info about who these customers are, what they've bought, and other things like that. So, if you were in charge of predicting customer churn, how would you go about using machine learning to make a good guess about which customers might leave? What steps would you take to create a machine learning model that can predict if someone's going to leave or not?

# step 1: Kaggle Dataset Search and download the CSV file.
# Step 2:  Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and dealing with outliers if necessary.

# you can create a jupiter notebook file, within your directory, and load the CSV file.
# Data Exploration: Begin by loading your dataset into a Python environment (e.g., using Pandas). 
# pip install pandas
# import pandas as pd

# load the dataset: df = pd.read_csv('Downloads/dataset_name.csv')

# View the Data: To check that the dataset loaded correctly, you can use various Pandas functions. Here are a few:

# df.head(): This shows the first few rows of the dataset.
# df.info(): This provides information about data types and missing values.
# df.describe(): This provides summary statistics for numerical columns.
    
# Handling Missing Values:

# Identify columns with missing values. You can use df.isnull().sum() to count missing values in each column.
# Decide on a strategy to handle missing values. Options include:
# Removing rows with missing values: Use df.dropna().
# Imputing missing values with a specific value (e.g., mean or median): Use df.fillna().
# Forward or backward fill for time-series data: Use df.ffill() or df.bfill().
# Data Type Conversion:

# Ensure that columns have the correct data types. For example, ensure that numerical columns are of numeric data types (int or float).
# Convert columns if necessary using df.astype() or other conversion methods.
# Handling Duplicates:

# Check for and remove duplicate rows using df.drop_duplicates().
# Data Validation:

# Validate the data to ensure it makes sense. For example, check that age values are within a reasonable range.
# Check for outliers and decide whether to remove or adjust them.
# Renaming Columns:

# If necessary, rename columns to make them more descriptive or easier to work with using df.rename().
# Data Transformation:

# If your project requires it, perform any data transformations, such as one-hot encoding categorical variables or scaling numerical features.
# Saving Cleaned Data:

# Save the cleaned dataset to a new file (e.g., CSV) using df.to_csv().
