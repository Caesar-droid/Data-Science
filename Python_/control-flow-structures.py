# Control flow structures in Python are constructs that allow you to control the order in which statements are executed in your code based on certain conditions. These structures help you make decisions, loop through code multiple times, and handle exceptional cases. Python supports the following control flow structures:

# Conditional Statements (if, elif, else):
# Loops (for and while):
# Control Statements (break, continue, pass):
